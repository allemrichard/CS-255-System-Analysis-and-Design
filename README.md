**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

DriverPass, a driving school company, is hoping to take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training students for the driving test at their local DMV. DriverPass wants a system that provides training to their customers through online practice tests and schedule on-the-road training online or by calling or visiting their office.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I believe I did well on analyzing and documenting the requirements DriverPass has for their system. I made sure I got every single one of the requirements that they had, and documented it concise and specific so the team can understand it. In addition, with feedback, I improved on the wording and set up of the requirement document for better quality of work.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I think I would choose the Use Case Diagram to revise, and I would improve it by adding an "Online practice test" use case since that was one of the needs DriverPass wanted for their system to provide to their clients. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the interview transcript provided and I implemented it by making sure that the design that I am working on meets those requirements. Since the project is user/client based, making sure to consider user's needs throughout the design is crucial. User satisfaction with the system is important for success of the systen, the team, the business, and for DriverPass. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

As I learned throughout this course, and previous courses, meeting requirements is very important in designing software. It could be business requirements, technical requirements, security requirements or even user interface requirements. For example, a color of the font for a sport's team is crucial since their team's color is a major part in their team recognition. In the future, I would continue to utilize interviews and good questions to get those requirements, and consistenly having those requirements in hand/in mind during the analysis and design process of the system. Either by having a formal document in hand at all times or an online bulletin board with the different requirements that they whole team has access to whenever they need it for reference.
